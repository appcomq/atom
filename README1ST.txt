Hello and thank you for downloading this Atom open source peer 2 peer cryptocurrency binary build.  In order to run the client, you must first initialize the blockchain by following the instructions below.  Failure to do this will result in an exception being thrown by the client.

*** NOTE: BEFORE RUNNING THE ATOM EXECUTABLE, YOU MUST COPY THE BLOCKCHAIN DIRECTORIES AS BELOW ***

Just wanted to say thanks again for your interest in Atom.  I've worked hard to put the software together along with the website, graphics, and everything else, with quite a lack of sleep.  There are a lot of coins out there, and more coming out every day - and I am a coin enthusiast just like the rest of you, mining all of the new coins that come out for fun.  I hope that Atom gains traction in ways that other coins have not.  For those who want more technical innovation - I've got something in the works in that direction called the Microdot Project that will be ready in the spring.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!
